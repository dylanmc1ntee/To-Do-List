<h1>To-Do List</h1>
<p>Hello, this is my first ever project using HTML, CSS, and JS. I started this project because I wanted to jump right into learning these languages.</p>
<p>
  The reason I chose to create a To-Do List was to help me keep up with school.
  In some of my classes, the teachers did not post the assignemnts to the calender.
  This is usually where I check to make sure I have done all of my work. This project is a solution to the problem I had.
